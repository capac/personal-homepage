I am freelance data scientist with many years of experience as a graduate student and postdoctoral researcher in astronomy. I have studied in Italy and the United States where I obtained my PhD in high-energy astrophysics, working on gamma-ray emissions from galactic sources.

I currently reside in the United Kingdom where have worked on different data science projects. I'm interested in data science, data visualization and machine learning.

Please feel free to contact me if you find my skills and experience useful. I can be reached by email, LinkedIn or GitHub.
