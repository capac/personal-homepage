![Monument Valley](/assets/about/monument-valley.jpg "Monument Valley")

I am freelance data scientist with many years of experience as a graduate student and postdoctoral researcher in astronomy. I have studied in Italy and the United States where I obtained my PhD in high-energy astrophysics, working on gamma-ray emissions from galactic sources.

I currently reside in the United Kingdom where I have worked on different data science projects. I'm interested in data science, data visualization, machine learning and deep learning. On a daily basis, I use _Python_, _pandas_, _scikit-learn_, _NumPy_, _SciPy_ as my main data science tools, and  _matplotlib_, _seaborn_, _bokeh_ for data visualization.
