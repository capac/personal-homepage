Sometimes you need to match to a standard format data that have less than par quality because of mispellings and typos. This can usually happen in the context of data in documents that require a certain level of quality and standardization, such as for example in addresses which require format and order for every different country. The article in DataCamp, [Fuzzy String Matching in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/fuzzy-string-python), gives a good breakdown of the topic of fuzzy matching in Python, and how it can be used to make data reach certain quality standards.

# Figure or image with caption
{% include image.html

    alt="Image title"
    caption="Image caption"

<!-- # Figure or image with zoom
<div class="click-zoom">

    <input type="checkbox">
    <img src="/assets/...">
  </label>
</div> -->
